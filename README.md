# TerminalAppGen3-CommandLine-Program
TerminalAppGen3 is a new addition to the TerminalApp series of programs. With a completely new engine and new UI interfaces, it's really easy to use and great for beginners starting out with terminals.

TerminalAppGen3 sports so many new things compared to the previous version (TerminalAppGen2), such as multithreading on some commands, word wrapping, RGB colours, some exception handling, and argument support for almost every command.
Colours are also brighter, making it more attractive for anyone. There are also so many more settings that you can adjust, to make your TerminalAppGen3 like home.

TerminalAppGen3 also now has new UI interfaces, where you can select using arrow keys and navigate through 'screens' using arrow keys. 
Also, due to the support of arguments, speed of navigation can increase, and can teach new users how terminals may work by arguments.

All of these above points, technologies and ease-of-use additions improve TerminalAppGen3 by a crazy amount. TerminalAppGen3 is now even more fun, and I hope you may try it today.
