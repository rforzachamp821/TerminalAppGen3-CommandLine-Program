# ZeeTerminal-CommandLine-Program
ZeeTerminal (previously named TerminalAppGen3) is a new addition to the TerminalApp series of programs, and very possibly starts a new ZeeTerminal series of its own. With a completely new engine and new UI interfaces, it's really easy to use and great for not only beginners starting out with terminals, but for more advanced users looking for a better terminal experience.

ZeeTerminal sports so many new things compared to the previous version (TerminalAppGen2), such as multithreading on some commands, word wrapping, RGB background/foreground colours, some exception handling, argument support for almost every command, and even some GUI elements.
Colours are also brighter, making it more attractive for anyone. There are also so many more settings that you can adjust, to make your ZeeTerminal like home.

ZeeTerminal also now has new UI interfaces which make it so much easier to use, where you can select options and navigate through 'screens', all using WASD and arrow keys. 
Also, due to the support of arguments, speed of navigation can increase, and can not only teach new users how terminals may work by arguments, but allow the more professional to get tasks done quicker.

Not only that, ZeeTerminal has so many more features coming soon, including games, more commands, some useful features and innovative systems that improve the overall terminal experience.

All of these above points, technologies and ease-of-use additions improve ZeeTerminal by a substantial amount. The TerminalApp/ZeeTerminal series is now even more fun, and I hope you may try it today.
